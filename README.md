# Evaluating Urban Bike-Sharing Accessibility

This GitHub repository contains code and resources used in the research this [paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4853905). The code is mainly in Python. 

Bike data is downloaded either from official websites or using the pybikes python library. OSM data has been used to get the city network, boundaries as well for creating isochrones for 5, 10 and 15 minutes. Population data is obtained from the Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL).  the population data is extracted from the GHS-POP spatial raster dataset. This layer provides the estimation of the number of people living in each 100x100 m cell in 5-year intervals from 1975 to 2030.
